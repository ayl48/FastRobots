# Lab 1A: Artemis Board
The goal of this lab was familiarize myself with the Redboard Artemis Nano board and the Arduino IDE through built-in examples and writing a short program.


## Prelab

Install the latest version of the Arduino IDE and Sparkfun Apollo3 Boardâ€™s manager. Copy the json link from [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/artemis-development-with-the-arduino-ide/setting-up-the-arduino-ide) and add it to the Arduino settings.

Connect the Artemis board to the computer via USB. Run the examples below.

## Blinky

Blinky switches the onboard LED on and off.

## Serial

The Serial example tests and verifies serial communication between the board and my computer, which is crucial for debugging as it enables me to monitor the board's activity.

## Temperature Readings With Analog Read

This example displays temperature readings from the onboard sensor on the serial monitor. When I apply heat, the temperature readings rise, indicating that the sensor and the analog read function are working.

## Microphone Output

This example displays the loudest frequencies detected by the microphone on the serial monitor. When I make a noise, the frequency changes printed on the serial monitor are obvious.

## C Note Detection With LED Indication

In this program, the LED lights up when the board detects the frequency of the C note and stays off for all other frequencies. I used a conditional statement in the printLoudest function for its implementation.

## Discussion

This lab was helpful in familiarizing myself with the peripherals and functionality of the Artemis Board Nano, including sensor data acquisition to audio processing and communication tasks.
