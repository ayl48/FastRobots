# About Me

## Annabel Lian

Welcome to my website for ECE 5160: Fast Robots, where I will be documenting my labs focused on the system-level design and implementation of fast, dynamic autonomous robots.
I am currently a Masters of Engineering student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. My academic interests lie in embedded systems and robotics. Outside of my academic pursuits, Iâ€™m training to be an aerialist and enjoy weight training.
